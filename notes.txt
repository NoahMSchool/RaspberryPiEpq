Notes:

PINS used so far:
    
    OUTPUT:
        GPIO
            simple for LED - 
            pin = RPi.GPIO.setup(number, GPIO.OUT)
            GPIO.output(number, GPIO.HIGH or GPIO.LOW)
        PWD 
            need for Pulse Width Modulation for Servo
            pwm = RPi.GPIO.PWM(number, frequency)
            pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(duty)
            Can also use gpiozero.Servo class


    INPUT:
        I2C Bus Protocol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C:
        https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/i2c-tutorial
            i2c = busio.I2C(board.SCL,board.SDA)
            Half Duplex


Thonny:
    Very useful setting to open all files from previous session
